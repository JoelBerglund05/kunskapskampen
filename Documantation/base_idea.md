# Quizz idea

global 1v1, rounds, most points wins, if points are equal then it end with sudden death.

* Time limit for the questions.
* If both are equal after, example, X amount of rounds then have a sudden death question about who is the closest to the answer. (how many years was Rome founded?)
* general questions.
* every other round you will be able to choose a category, you will only be able to choose a category once per match.
